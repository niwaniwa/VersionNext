# Version Next
This software takes an array of semantic versioning strings (e.g., 2.3.1, 2.4.0-rc.1, 2.3.2-beta.1) and calculates the next logical version based on the given versions. It follows the rules of semantic versioning (SemVer), considering major, minor, and patch numbers, as well as pre-release and build metadata. The software is designed to help developers automatically determine the next version in a sequence, making version management easier and more efficient.
